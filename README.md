# AI-ML-Deployment
 
This project demonstrates a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST dataset. It includes a Django application with a REST API for making predictions and MySQL for data storage. The application is containerized using Docker and deployed on Kubernetes with Minikube.

Project Components
•	CNN Model for MNIST Dataset: Built using TensorFlow/Keras.
•	Django Application: A web application with an API endpoint for digit recognition.
•	MySQL Database: Used for storing request details and prediction results.
•	Docker Containerization: The Django application and MySQL database are containerized.
•	Kubernetes Deployment: Using Minikube for orchestration of containers.
